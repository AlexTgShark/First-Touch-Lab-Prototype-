# First Touch Lab

A functional, browser-only football training prototype. **Train with purpose. Improve every touch.** Built with React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Lucide icons, and Recharts. No backend, accounts, keys, tracking, paid tools, or runtime network services.

## View on GitHub Pages

The complete website source and a prebuilt browser-ready site are in this repository. To publish on GitHub:

1. Open **Settings → Pages** in this repository.
2. Under **Build and deployment**, choose **Deploy from a branch**.
3. Select **main**, folder **/docs**, and click **Save**.
4. Wait for GitHub to deploy, then use the site link shown by GitHub Pages.

No secrets or API keys are needed. This chat environment cannot change the Pages setting through the GitHub API. GitHub's own Actions infrastructure may need to be enabled for its built-in Pages deployment. If you change source code, run `npm ci` and `npm run build:pages`, then commit the updated `docs/` folder along with your source. The generated build uses relative asset paths and hash navigation so it works under a repository subpath.

## Expanded drill training

The library includes **60 drills**: the requested 48 (8 each for 1, 2, 3, and 4 outfield players and 4 goalkeeper drills for each participant count) plus the original 12 solo drills. Every drill has a stable string ID, instructions, target, equipment, space, difficulty, progression, common mistakes, and safety guidance. A goalkeeper counts as one of the total participants.

**Add to Dashboard** saves and selects the exact drill. Repeating it does not duplicate the drill or count as training. Saved cards support details, scheduling, selection, and confirmed removal. Removing a saved drill preserves scheduled and completed sessions. **Schedule Drill** opens the planner with the same drill ID, participant count, focus, and duration. Valid scheduling drafts survive refresh, including edited dates and durations; cancelling discards a draft. Training forms also let you choose a drill directly. Completion records actual minutes and an optional performance note, feeding history, weekly statistics, skill breakdowns, and Recently Completed Drills.

Goalkeeper training has a dedicated tab, participant filters, and gradual-progression safety guidance. Three original schematic diagrams cover Cone Slalom, Triangle Passing, and the four-person 2v1 attack against goalkeeper. Other drills have participant rosters rather than misleading reused diagrams.

## Open a standalone preview (no installation)

Download `First-Touch-Lab-Preview.zip`, extract it, then open `First-Touch-Lab.html` in Chrome, Edge, or Firefox on your computer. Do not choose “Open in → ChatGPT”; that opens the file in chat rather than running the website. This HTML includes the actual app, styles, icons, and charts; no server or internet connection is needed. The self-contained bundle is tested in Chromium; local-file storage behavior can vary by browser. Managed test browsers block direct file navigation, so the test loads the exact HTML through an intercepted document request and checks it needs no external assets. Export a JSON backup to preserve your training. A file preview and localhost use separate storage.

To generate the standalone HTML from source:

```sh
npm ci
npm run build:portable
```

Open `downloads/First-Touch-Lab.html`. Cloud-host localhost addresses refer to the cloud machine and cannot be opened as localhost on your own computer. For the development workflow below, run the commands on your own computer.

## Run locally

Use Node.js **22.6 or newer** (tested with Node 24) and npm.

```sh
cd First-Touch-Lab-Prototype-
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** in your browser. Vite prints another port if 5173 is in use. To serve the production build instead:

```sh
npm run build
npm run preview
```

Open the address printed by Vite (normally http://localhost:4173). Use localhost or HTTPS: UUID generation requires a secure context. Install packages once with internet access; the running app makes no external requests. All artwork is inline SVG/CSS and typography uses system fonts.

## What works

- Public home page with feature links, live workspace access, how-it-works section, and FAQ.
- Dashboard statistics and activity charts computed from stored training, weekly goals, streaks, upcoming sessions, recent history, and active challenges.
- Weekly planner with navigation, dated/timed sessions, focus, duration, notes, editing, deletion, and actual-minute completion. Completing a future plan records the session on today's date; you can adjust to an earlier actual date.
- Standalone training logs; editable/deletable history and skill filters; session and minute targets.
- Five repeatable skill tests, historical results and charts, baseline comparisons, and deletion. Dribble times treat lower as better; other tests treat higher as better. Tests are personal practice measures, not overall ability ratings.
- Six challenges whose progress derives from actual logged work. Daily challenges count distinct dates; passing and dribbling count sessions. First-touch challenge counts test dates. Only entries dated on/after the start date count. There is no deadline or consecutive-day requirement. Full rules appear on each card. Existing entries from the same day can count; deleting/editing eligible data recalculates progress. Completion produces a celebration notification. Challenges can be abandoned and restarted without deleting logs.
- Sixty drills with player-count tabs, dedicated goalkeeper training, search, skill/difficulty/equipment filters, favorites, exact Add to Dashboard and Schedule Drill integration.
- Persistent preferences, safe JSON backup import/export, demo-data controls, and confirmed destructive actions.
- Responsive sidebar/mobile navigation, keyboard focus trapping and Escape for dialogs, reduced-motion support, empty states, and invalid-storage recovery.

## Local data and sample content

A first visit seeds clearly labeled **Demo** sessions, tests, and an active challenge. Dashboard totals include these entries. **Start fresh** or **Settings → Remove sample data** removes demo entries while preserving your own records. Editing a sample session makes that edited record your own. Settings can enable new samples or reset the entire workspace to empty, with confirmation.

Data uses schema version 2 under the existing localStorage key `first-touch-lab-v1`. Version-one history, preferences, test results, challenges, and numeric favorites automatically migrate; legacy favorite IDs map to the retained original drills. Version-one JSON backups can also be imported. Invalid or orphaned references are rejected. Data is scoped to the browser and site origin. Refreshes preserve data; switching devices, browsers, ports, or origins does not transfer it. Clearing storage can delete it. Export a JSON backup before clearing storage. Imports validate the full schema and value ranges before asking to replace the workspace (maximum file size 5 MB). Corrupt saved data opens an empty workspace with a warning. Storage failures show a warning and keep the current in-memory state usable; export before closing.

No email, birth date, location, or social profile is requested. Use a nickname and avoid sensitive information in notes. Drills are general practice suggestions, not professional coaching or medical advice. Warm up, allow rest, and stop if you feel pain.

## Checks

```sh
npm test                 # 14 data-model tests, no browser needed
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run format:check
```

Browser journeys use Playwright (the test command also builds and tests the Pages site at its repository subpath and the standalone HTML):

```sh
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:e2e        # starts Vite automatically if needed
```

For an existing Chromium installation, set `PLAYWRIGHT_CHROMIUM_EXECUTABLE` to its full executable path. On Linux, Playwright may need system browser libraries (`npx playwright install --with-deps chromium`). Eight browser tests cover the exact two-player selection/refresh, three-player scheduling/draft restoration, four-person goalkeeper roster/diagram/selection, solo completion/progress, removal without history loss, mobile tabs/filters and the landing page, goals and refresh, tomorrow's plan/edit/completion, totals, repeated skill tests, challenge progress, favorite drills, backup/reset/restore, corrupted storage, and navigation/layout at 320px. Screenshots and traces are generated in ignored paths. No lint command is configured; TypeScript and Prettier checks are provided.

For manual testing: start fresh, set a goal, plan tomorrow, edit it, mark it complete with actual minutes, and check Dashboard/Progress Tracker. Record two first-touch scores, start a relevant challenge and log eligible work, save a drill, refresh, then export/reset/import a backup. Also test the mobile menu, cancel destructive prompts, and close dialogs with Escape.

## Structure

- `src/model.ts`: types, seed data, statistics, challenge rules, backup validation.
- `src/drills.ts`: typed 60-drill catalog with stable IDs.
- `src/DrillFeatures.tsx`: catalog, details, diagrams, saved/current drill UI.
- `src/main.tsx`: app navigation, reusable UI, pages, forms, persistence.
- `src/style.css`: responsive visual system and original pitch graphics.
- `src/model.test.ts`, `tests/*.spec.ts`: domain, migration, catalog, regression, mobile, and standalone validation.
- `scripts/`: standalone HTML and GitHub Pages packaging.
- `docs/`: prebuilt GitHub Pages site, regenerated with `npm run build:pages`.

## Demonstration-only and limitations

**Future Premium Features** is a concept comparison. **$2.99/month is illustrative future pricing — not currently available.** There is no checkout, subscription, advertising, or purchase simulation. Core functionality is free.

This prototype has no cloud sync, coaching assessment, calendar integration, reminders, multi-user collaboration, or cross-tab conflict resolution. Incomplete invalid form fields are not persisted as drafts. Performance results are optional free-text practice notes, not automatically parsed scores. Skill results can be removed and re-recorded; training logs can be edited directly. Challenges use date-based eligibility rather than an event audit trail. Very large histories are not paginated. The seven-day planner wraps into a compact grid on phones. Tested automated browser coverage uses Chromium; Safari/Firefox and assistive technology checks remain useful before wider launch.

Future work: test with 5–10 amateur players, learn which workflows they return to, improve accessibility with user feedback, add optional local reminders/templates, and only consider account syncing or paid features after validating regular use.
